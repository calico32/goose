  <h2>Download goose</h2>

  <p>
    goose is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the latest release from the <a
      href="https://github.com/calico32/goose/releases" class="text-blue-400">GitHub repository</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    goose ships a single binary that you can run from the command line. To install goose, download the binary for your
    operating system and move it to a directory in your <code>PATH</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Build from source</h3>

  <p>
    If you prefer to build goose from source, you'll need <a href="https://go.dev">Go</a> installed on your computer.
    Then, clone the <a href="https://github.com/calico32/goose" class="text-blue-400">GitHub repository</a> and run
    `make goose` to build. The resulting binary will be in the `build` directory.

  <h2>Editor support</h2>

  <p>
    goose supports the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for code completion, diagnostics, and other editor features,
    except for syntax highlighting, which is currently Visual Studio Code only. An extension for Visual Studio Code is
    available in the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=calico32.goose"
      class="text-blue-400">Visual Studio Code Marketplace</a>. Support for other editors is not planned, but creating
    an extension for your favorite editor is simple. Check out the <a href="/docs/language/server"
      class="text-blue-400">Language Server Protocol</a> documentation for more information.
  </p>

  <h2>Write your first goose program</h2>

  <p>
    Take the <a href="/docs/language-tour" class="text-blue-400">goose language tour</a> to learn the basics of the
    language. The tour covers the most important features of goose and is a great way to get started.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you've completed the tour, you can explore the rest of the documentation to learn more about goose's features
    and how to use them in your programs.
  </p>

  <h2>Remember, goose is a work in progress</h2>

  <p>
    There will most definitely be bugs and missing features in goose. If you encounter any issues, please report them on
    the <a href="https://github.com/calico32/goose/issues" class="text-blue-400">GitHub issue tracker</a>. Your feedback
    is invaluable and will help make goose better for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for trying out goose!
