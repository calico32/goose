  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold ">Language Syntax</h1>

  <p>
    goose has a minimal syntax that aims to be highly readable. In this section, we'll cover the syntax rules and
    conventions of the goose language in-depth.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>If you're new to goose, we recommend starting with the <a class="text-blue-400"
        href="/docs/language/tour">Language Tour</a> to get a quick overview of the language.</i>
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Syntax Rules</h2>
  <p>
    goose classifies code into <strong>statements</strong> and <strong>expressions</strong>. A statement can be thought
    of an action, while an expression represents a usable value. For example, <code>let x = 5</code> is a statement that
    assigns the value <code>5</code> to the variable <code>x</code>, while <code>5 + 5</code> is an expression that
    evaluates to <code>10</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Statements can only be written in certain contexts, like the top-level of a file or inside a function. Expressions,
    however, can be written almost anywhere, including where statements are expected.
  </p>
  {{codeBlock `goose` `
  <pre>
    // statement context
    let x = 5

    x // expression as statement

    if /* expression context */ x > 0
      // new statement context
    end

    if let y = x + 5 // invalid statement where expression is expected // [!code error]
      println(y)
    end
  </pre>
  `}}

  <p>
    Statements don't need to be separated by a semicolon or any other delimiter. In fact, statements don't even need to
    be on separate lines! The parser can work out where one statement ends and another begins based on the syntax rules
    of the language. However, it is recommended to use new lines to separate statements for readability.
  </p>

  {{codeBlock `goose` `
  <pre>
    // completely valid! but not recommended
    let x = 5 let y = 10 println(x + y)

    // equivalent to:
    let x = 5
    let y = 10
    println(x + y)
  </pre>
  `}}

  <p>
    Inside blocks, whitespace isn't significant either, but indenting each level by 2 spaces is recommended for
    readability and clarity.
  </p>
  {{codeBlock `goose` `
  <pre>
    if x > 5
    println("x is greater than 5")
    end

    // equivalent to:
    if x > 5
      println("x is greater than 5")
    end
  </pre>
  `}}

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Comments</h2>
  <p>
    goose supports both single-line and multi-line comments. Single-line comments start with <code>//</code> and
    continue until the end of the line. Multi-line comments start with <code>/*</code> and end with <code>*/</code>.
    Multi-line comments cannot be nested.
  </p>
  {{codeBlock `goose` `
  <pre>
    // this is a single-line comment

    /*
      This is a multi-line comment
      that spans multiple lines
    */
  </pre>
  `}}

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Identifiers</h2>
  <p>
    Identifiers are used to name variables, functions, and other entities in goose. An identifier must start with a
    letter or an underscore and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Identifiers are case-sensitive. By
    convention, identifiers should be written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case"
      class="text-blue-400">snake_case</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    More formally, all valid identifiers must match the regular expression
    <code>[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*</code>.
  </p>

  {{codeBlock `goose` `
  <pre>
    let my_variable = 5
    fn hello_world()
      println("Hello, World!")
    end

    // invalid identifiers
    let 1variable = 5 // cannot start with a number // [!code error]
    let my-variable = 5 // cannot contain hyphens // [!code error]
    let $varia@ble = 5 // cannot contain special characters (except underscore) // [!code error]
  </pre>
  `}}

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Keywords</h2>

  <p>
    goose has a set of reserved keywords that cannot be used as identifiers. These keywords are used to define the
    structure of the language and cannot be redefined or shadowed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following is a list of all the keywords in goose:
  </p>

  {{codeBlock `` `
  <pre>
  let       const     symbol    if      then    else
  repeat    while     forever   times   for     in
  break     continue  fn        end     return  memo
  import    export    as        show    is      generator
  yield     to        step      struct  init    operator
  try       catch     finally   throw   do      async
  await     native    match     when    frozen
  </pre>
  `}}
